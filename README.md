## Compatibility
The patcher makes a single compatibility patch for basically every mod you have installed. This works all fine in theory.
The only problems are quest item. They will be processed by the patcher if they are not on a blacklist.
This blacklist will be constantly updated to assure compatibility for as many mods as possible.
The following quest mods are already compatible:
* Clothing and Clutter Fixes ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43053))
* Weapons and Armor Fixes Remade ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34093))
